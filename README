Goatee - a monadic take on a 2,500-year-old board game

Website: http://khumba.net/projects/goatee

Goatee is a game editor for Go, written in Haskell.  It is developed in two
parts: a library for working with SGF files, and a GUI for filling your Go
fancy.  It aims to be full-featured, supporting all of the SGF spec and allowing
for full customization of the game records you create.
