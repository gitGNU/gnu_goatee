Goatee is a Go library and game editor, written in Haskell.  It provides a GUI
for recording, studying, and editing game records.  Underneath this is a
portable library for manipulating SGF files, to build UIs and tools.  Goatee
aims to be full-featured, supporting all of the SGF spec and allowing for full
customization of the game records you create.

This repository contains three Cabal projects:

- goatee: The shared library for working with game records.

- goatee-gtk: A GTK+ UI.  Depends on goatee.

- goatee-wx: An initial prototype of a wxWidgets UI.  Depends on goatee.  Not
  currently under development.

* Development

Goatee is generously hosted on Savannah.

Source:  http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/goatee.git
Bugs:    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=goatee

To check out a fresh copy of the source code, run:

  $ git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/goatee.git goatee.git

If you will be doing development, enable the pre-commit script:

  $ cd goatee.git
  $ ln -s ../../scripts/git-pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit

The 'goatee' project builds on its own and has no intra-repository dependencies.
To build one of the UIs, the recommended method is to use Cabal sandboxes:

  $ cd goatee.git/goatee-gtk
  $ cabal sandbox init
  $ cabal install ../goatee
  $ cabal configure --enable-tests && cabal run
